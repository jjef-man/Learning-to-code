## CSS tips

1. Choose good color scheme.  
2. Master **flexbox**. Rows and columns and subsequent rows and columns.  
3. **Responsivity** - start to design in mobile first for overall better responsivity.  
4. Memorize breakpoints. Breakpoints are the widths or dimensions of the page of which the styling  changes to retain responsivity.  
    - small - 640px     >
    - medium - 768px    > use in media query *@media (min-width: value)*
    - large - 1024px    >
